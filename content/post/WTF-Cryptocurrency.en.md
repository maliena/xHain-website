WTF are Cryptocurrencies?

We want to give you an introduction into the world of cryptocurencies.
There will be a talk covering the following questions:

1. Was are the basics of modern cryptocurrencies? What is a Blockchain?
2. Bitcoin, Ethereum and Zcash.
	- What are the similarities? 
	- Where are the differnces?
	- What are the core-concepts.?
3. Proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake

As it's unlikely that all questions can be answered in a talk, there will be the opportunity to talk and discuss afterwards.

The cryptocurrency-evening starts at 7:30pm on Friday, July 7th.
